# 1. Read Me First!

So you want to start tracking your ocean shipments and containers and you have a few BL numbers. Follow the guide. 

Our API responses use [JSONAPI](https://jsonapi.org/) schema. There are [client libraries](https://jsonapi.org/implementations/#client-libraries) available in almost every language. Our API should work with these libs out of the box. 

Our APIs can be used with any HTTP client; choose your favorite! We love Postman, it's a friendly graphical interface to a powerful cross-platform HTTP client. Best of all it has support for the OpenAPI specs that we publish with all our APIs. We have created a collection of requests for you to easily test the API endpoints with your API Key. Link to the collection below.
